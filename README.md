# Todo-App

This todo app allows users to create and maintain their own tasks in exchange for tokens. All tasks are publicly stored on the ethereum blockchain (ropsten testnet). Users have the option to lock in ethereum to help motivate them with their specific task or goal.

### How does it work?
1. User logs into their Metamask account (Must have testnet ethereum for ropsten network)
2. Users can then create a todo by clicking the add button. A completion date as well as content for the todo are required.
3. (optional) Users can lock a certain amount of ethereum with each task
4. Users can then click the switch on each todo to mark them as complete. The deposit as well as tokens are returned to the user if a deposit was given

### How can I use it?
